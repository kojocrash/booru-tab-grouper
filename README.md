a chrome extension

## Features

- Attempts to group Booru tabs by artist/primary tag
- Allows you to add support for Boorus yourself (advanced)
- Can do a backflip

## Supported Boorus

- Gelbooru
- Danbooru

## Install

[**Chrome** extension](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)

Check releases for latest version and load the extension via "Load unpacked" option. There's tutorials on how to load unpacked extensions. 

## Notes
- The extension works doesn't actually look at the tab's content, but rathher details about the tab (title and/or url). There are bound to be inaccuracies.
- Saved tab groups are not editable and currently produce an error when dealing with tabs within one and/or the group itself. As of now, chrome does not allow extensions to touch them at all so you will have to unsave them if needed 

## Contribution

idk. maybe make an actual installation guide for me
